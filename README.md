# Minerancher [![Maven CI](https://github.com/lexikiq/minecraft-slime-rancher/workflows/Maven%20CI/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/lexikiq/minecraft-slime-rancher/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Maven+CI%22)

[This project has been succeeded.](https://github.com/lexikiq/minerancher)

~~Minerancher is a heavily work-in-progress 1.16.1 [Paper](https://papermc.io/) plugin that is aiming to recreate [Slime Rancher](http://slimerancher.com/) inside of Minecraft.~~

~~Code is definitely sloppy as this is a learning experience for me for Java and plugins but I hope it isn't too bad to understand :)~~

## Installation

~~Detailed steps will be included later, but you'll want to compile the package through maven and drop it into your server's plugin folder (Spigot is untested and may not work, pls use Paper)~~

~~Builds are alternatively available for each commit from the [Actions tab](https://github.com/lexikiq/minecraft-slime-rancher/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Maven+CI%22).~~

~~Users should install [OptiFine](https://optifine.net/downloads) and the [project's resource pack](https://github.com/lexikiq/minecraft-slime-rancher-resource-pack) to see the Slime textures. (For bonus points, add it as a server resource pack!)~~

## Currently Implemented

- ~~Slimes that spawn in the world are automatically set to Pink or Honey slimes.~~

- ~~Tarrs seek out Slimes to eat them and convert them to Tarrs, and also still hunt players.~~

## TODO

~~Check out the [issues page](https://github.com/lexikiq/minecraft-slime-rancher/labels/todo).~~
